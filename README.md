utility modules ive made and used for my games

some of them do contain functions that relate only to my game and will be useless / wont work for yours, feel free to remove those\
^ all of the modules expect to be parented under an actor, so they intermittently make use of parallel luau, you can remove the task.desynchronize() and task.synchronize() calls if you don't plan to work with parallel luau


if you're going to make pull requests make sure you generally follow the formatting i have for the module youre editing
